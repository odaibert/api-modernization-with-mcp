# Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run the workshop.

---

## :material-numeric-1-circle: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/odaibert/api-modernization-with-mcp.git
cd api-modernization-with-mcp
```

## :material-numeric-2-circle: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

## :material-numeric-3-circle: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

## :material-numeric-4-circle: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## :material-numeric-5-circle: Open the Notebook

Navigate to `labs/expose-rest-api-as-mcp/` and open **`expose-rest-api-as-mcp.ipynb`** in VS Code.

## :material-numeric-6-circle: Run the Lab

You have two options:

=== "Run All"

    Click **Run All** at the top of the notebook to execute every step sequentially. The entire deployment takes approximately 15–20 minutes (APIM provisioning is the longest step).

=== "Step by Step"

    Execute each cell individually to understand what each step does. The notebook is organized into clearly labeled sections with markdown explanations.

## What the Notebook Does

| Step | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **0️⃣ Initialize** | ~1s | Set variables, generate unique resource suffix |
| **1️⃣ Verify Azure CLI** | ~2s | Confirm login and subscription |
| **🧪 Local test** | ~5s | Start MCP server locally, verify 5 tools |
| **2️⃣ Deploy to Azure** | ~15min | Bicep deployment (APIM takes longest) |
| **3️⃣ Get outputs** | ~5s | Retrieve URLs, keys, resource names |
| **4️⃣ Build & deploy** | ~3min | Build container in ACR, deploy to Container Apps |
| **🧪 Test tools** | ~10s | Discover and call all MCP tools through APIM |
| **🧪 Agent Framework** | ~15s | AI agent uses MCP tools to answer a question |
| **🗑️ Clean up** | ~1min | Delete the resource group |

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "APIM provisioning takes ~10-15 minutes"

    The BasicV2 SKU deployment is the longest step. The notebook will wait for it to complete.

!!! warning "Azure CLI not found"

    If `az` is not found, ensure it's installed and on your PATH. The notebook automatically detects common install locations on macOS.

!!! tip "Each run is isolated"

    The notebook generates a unique random suffix for every execution, creating a new resource group each time. You can run multiple experiments in parallel without conflicts.
